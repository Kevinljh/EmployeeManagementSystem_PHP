# EMS
Semester long project for Software Quality 2

## Features to show Demo Day
### User Experience / User Interface
* search-engine-friendly (and people friendly) urls
* routing through one php script so php isn't exposed if php fails
* fancy navigation
* urls change as user navigates without refreshing/changing page
* Instant search (search as user is typing)
* errors show up as user is entering information (not when user presses save)
* error validation is both client side and server side, so error messages are fast but server is still secure
* no page reloading (i.e. no white flicker, no additional server request, not loading html that has already been loaded)
* meta information (SEO, good practice)
